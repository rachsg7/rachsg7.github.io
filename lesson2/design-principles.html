        <h1>Three Mobile Websites Using Good Design Principles</h1>
        <h2>1. <a href="https://www.mollymoon.com/">Molly Moon's</a></h2>
        <p>Molly Moon's website is a good example of using white space and clean design. Its sans-serif font combined with minimum words and lots of white space makes it easy to find what you're looking for without excessive clutter.

        <h2>2. <a href="https://www.dominos.com/en/">Domino's</a></h2>
        <p>Domino's website is a good example of alignment. Everything on the page is aligned close to the edges. If it weren't so aligned, it would look messy, but all the text, images, and link blocks are lined up to give it a cohesive look.

        <h2>3. <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/?esch=1">Shutterfly</a></h2>
        <p>Shutterfly's website is a good example of contrast. Its company logo is bright orange and white which are highly contrasting, and they use that contrast in other areas of their website. The sign in button is bright orange, and sticks out easily
            on the page. The sales prices are also orange which helps highlight their importance.
